# ShiftMind Manager

This is the Admin Console for Shiftmind and will work hand-in-hand with the ShiftMind Checkin app that was built with Flutter. The Flutter app is the end-point for users that will be used for checking in and checking out with a barcode or QR code. 

The Admin console will then display the time stamps and show the hours worked by staff and will also be used to track schedules, scheduled time off and time-off requests. This will allow small businesses to go paperless and provide an easier solution for business owners to track hours and schedules. 

This is a React App built with Vite. The back-end data base solution is Google Firebase Firestore which is already integrated with the mobile app, built with Flutter.
